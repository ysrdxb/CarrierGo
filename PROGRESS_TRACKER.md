# CarrierGo - Development Progress Tracker

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Week 1 Complete ✅

## Week 1: Multi-Tenancy Foundation & Admin Tenant Creation

### ✅ Completed Tasks

#### 1. **Multi-Tenancy Architecture (SHARED Database Mode)**
- ✅ Implemented SHARED database mode (single database for all tenants)
- ✅ Created `tenant_id` column on all relevant tables
- ✅ Created `TenantScope` global scope for automatic query filtering
- ✅ Created `BelongsToTenant` trait with defensive null checks
- ✅ Database: `carrierlab` (single shared database)
- ✅ Tenant isolation via `tenant_id` column filtering

#### 2. **Tenant Model & Database Schema**
- ✅ Created Tenants table with columns:
  - `id` - Primary key
  - `name` - Tenant name
  - `domain` - Subdomain (e.g., "abc-logistics")
  - `subscription_plan` - Free/Starter/Professional/Enterprise
  - `subscription_status` - active/inactive/suspended
  - `subscription_expires_at` - Trial/subscription expiration
  - `created_by_admin` - Boolean flag for admin-created tenants
  - `approval_status` - pending/approved/rejected
  - `trial_days` - Trial period (default: 14)
  - `trial_expires_at` - When trial expires
  - `tenancy_mode` - SHARED or SEPARATE (for future use)
  - `database_connection` - For SEPARATE mode (future)

#### 3. **User & Company Setup**
- ✅ Added `tenant_id` to users table (foreign key)
- ✅ Added `tenant_id` to companies table (foreign key)
- ✅ Created Companies table with:
  - `id`, `tenant_id`, `name`, `address`, `zip_code`, `city`, `country`
- ✅ User can have default role (Super Admin, Admin, User)
- ✅ Admin users can create tenants and employees

#### 4. **Middleware & Context Management**
- ✅ Created `SetTenantContext` middleware (sets current tenant in app container)
- ✅ Middleware runs on every request to maintain tenant context
- ✅ Proper error handling for authenticated users without tenant_id
- ✅ Graceful fallback if tenant context fails

#### 5. **Authentication & Session Management**
- ✅ Fixed session storage: changed from DATABASE to FILE mode
- ✅ Session driver: `file` (no database dependency)
- ✅ Cache store: `array` (in-memory, no persistence needed)
- ✅ Queue connection: `sync` (synchronous, no background processing)
- ✅ OTP-based email verification (6-digit code)
- ✅ Admin password set to: `Test@12345`

#### 6. **Bug Fixes & Stability**
- ✅ **Fixed 500 Error Root Cause**: SetTenantContext was calling `tenancy()->initialize()` from disabled Stancl/Tenancy package
  - Changed to simple app-level tenant_id instance management
  - No database switching needed for SHARED mode
  - All authenticated pages now load without errors

- ✅ **Fixed Session Management**:
  - Changed from database-stored sessions to file-based sessions
  - Prevents stale tenant_id from persisting across logout/login cycles
  - Added explicit tenant_id clearing on logout

- ✅ **Fixed Missing Database Column**:
  - Added `country` column to companies table

- ✅ **Disabled Stancl/Tenancy Package**:
  - Disabled auto-database switching in TenancyServiceProvider
  - Uses SHARED database mode instead of SEPARATE per-tenant databases

#### 7. **Registration Flow (Phase 2 Start)**
- ✅ Created `RegisterTenant` Livewire component for self-registration
- ✅ Created `CompanySetup` Livewire component for company information
- ✅ Created email verification with token-based link
- ✅ Guest layout with navbar and footer
- ✅ Inline validation for all form fields
- ✅ Real-time domain availability checking
- ✅ Plan selection with white text on selected button
- ✅ Password confirmation validation (only on submit, not while typing)

#### 8. **Error Handling & Logging**
- ✅ Created custom `500.blade.php` error page (shows debug info in development)
- ✅ Added error view (`error.blade.php`) for application-level errors
- ✅ Created `Logout` action with tenant context cleanup
- ✅ Enhanced SettingService with try-catch error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive logging throughout authentication flow

#### 9. **Code Quality**
- ✅ All PHP files: No syntax errors
- ✅ Proper type hints and documentation
- ✅ Error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Consistent Laravel/Bootstrap styling
- ✅ Professional variable naming
- ✅ Git repository initialized and commits made

### 📊 Database Schema Summary

**Tables with tenant_id**:
- users (tenant_id)
- companies (tenant_id)
- references (tenant_id)
- invoices (tenant_id)
- shipments (tenant_id)
- freights (tenant_id)
- destinations (tenant_id)
- And 15+ other tables for full multi-tenant data isolation

**Core Tenant Flow**:
```
Tenant Created → User Created (with tenant_id) → Company Created (with tenant_id) → Access Dashboard
```

---

### 🧪 Testing Status

**Login Flow** ✅
- Register with email/password
- Email verification with token link
- Company setup form
- Login with credentials
- OTP entry and verification
- Dashboard access with proper data isolation

**Database Verification** ✅
```bash
php artisan tinker
# Check user has tenant_id
DB::table('users')->where('email', 'admin@carriergo.com')->first();
# Should show: tenant_id = 1

# Check company has tenant_id
DB::table('companies')->first();
# Should show: tenant_id = 1
```

**Authenticated Page Access** ✅
- `/dashboard` - Shows admin dashboard
- `/user/reference` - Shows user dashboard (based on role)
- All pages respect tenant_id filtering

---

### 🔧 Configuration Summary

**Environment (.env)**:
- `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`
- `DB_DATABASE=carrierlab` (single shared database)
- `SESSION_DRIVER=file` (file-based sessions)
- `CACHE_STORE=array` (in-memory cache)
- `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync` (synchronous execution)
- `APP_DEBUG=true` (development mode)

**Key Features**:
- SHARED database multi-tenancy
- Query automatic tenant_id filtering
- Session-based authentication
- OTP email verification
- Admin can create tenants + employees in one step
- Self-registration with email verification

---

### 📝 Known Limitations & Future Work

**Current (SHARED Database Mode)**:
- All tenants use same database (carrierlab)
- Data isolation via tenant_id column filtering
- Faster, simpler, good for small-medium scale
- Single point of failure if database goes down

**Future (SEPARATE Database Mode)**:
- Each tenant could have own database
- Better isolation and security
- Higher infrastructure cost
- Code is already prepared for this (`getDatabaseConnection()` in Tenant model)
