# Phase 1: Quick Start - Test Admin Tenant Creation

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

Admin can create a tenant with an employee in **one step**, and the system automatically:
- Creates the tenant record
- Provisions a new database
- Creates all tables
- Creates the employee/admin user
- Sends credentials email
- Employee can login immediately!

## ⚡ Quick Test (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Login to Admin Panel
```
URL: http://localhost/carriergo/admin/tenants
Email: admin@carriergo.com
Password: admin@123456
```

### Step 2: Create New Tenant
Click **"+ New Tenant"** button (green button top right)

### Step 3: Fill The Form

**Tenant Information Section:**
- Tenant Name: `ABC Logistics`
- Domain: `abc-logistics`
- Plan: `Professional ($299/month)`
- Status: `Active`

**First Employee/Admin Section:**
- First Name: `John`
- Last Name: `Doe`
- Email: `john@abclogistics.com`
- Auto-generate password: ✓ (checked)

### Step 4: Click "Save Tenant"

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Success message: "Tenant created successfully! Credentials email sent to john@abclogistics.com"
✅ Modal closes
✅ New tenant appears in list
```

## 🔍 Verify Everything Works

### Check 1: Tenant Created
```
Go back to /admin/tenants
You should see: "ABC Logistics" in the list
Status: Active
Domain: abc-logistics
```

### Check 2: Database Created
```sql
-- In MySQL command line or phpMyAdmin:
SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'carriergo_tenant_%';

-- You should see:
carriergo_tenant_2 (or highest ID number)
```

### Check 3: User Created
```sql
-- In MySQL:
USE carriergo_tenant_2;
SELECT * FROM users;

-- You should see:
Email: john@abclogistics.com
FirstName: John
LastName: Doe
```

### Check 4: Email (Would Be) Sent
Check Laravel logs:
```
storage/logs/laravel.log

Look for: "Successfully created admin user john@abclogistics.com"
```

## 🔑 What Employee Receives

If email is configured, John Doe would receive:

```
From: noreply@carriergo.com
Subject: Your ABC Logistics Account is Ready! 🎉

Hi John,

Your account has been successfully created and is ready to use!

## Your Login Details

Email Address:

[Click to Login Button]

## Quick Tips

2. Set Up Your Profile
3. Invite Team Members
4. Read Documentation

## 👤 Employee Login Test

After tenant is created:

1. **Add domain to hosts file** (Windows):
   ```
   Edit: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
   Add line: 127.0.0.1 abc-logistics.carriergo.local
   ```

2. **Visit login page:**
   ```
   http://abc-logistics.carriergo.local/login
   ```

3. **Login with:**
   ```
   Email: john@abclogistics.com
   Password: (from the email, or what you see in the success message)
   ```

4. **Expected Result:**
   ```
   ✅ Dashboard loads
   ✅ Shows "ABC Logistics" in header
   ✅ No data (new tenant)
   ✅ Only employee's company data (isolated)
   ```

## 🧪 Test Multiple Tenants

### Create Second Tenant

Repeat steps above with:
- Tenant Name: `XYZ Transport`
- Domain: `xyz-transport`
- Employee: `jane@xyztransport.com`

### Verify Isolation

Test that data is completely separated:

```sql
-- Check Tenant 1 (ABC)
USE carriergo_tenant_2;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users; -- Should show 1 (John)

-- Check Tenant 2 (XYZ)
USE carriergo_tenant_3;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users; -- Should show 1 (Jane)

-- Different databases = complete isolation! ✅
```

## ❌ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Form shows empty employee fields

**Solution:**
- Modal might not refresh, close and open again
- Or refresh page with F5

### Issue: "Domain must be unique"

**Solution:**
- That domain already exists
- Use a different domain (abc-logistics-2, test-abc, etc.)

### Issue: Can't fill employee password when unchecked

**Solution:**
- Click checkbox to toggle: "Auto-generate password"
- Uncheck it to manually enter password
- Password must be 8+ characters

### Issue: "Email Address is required"

**Solution:**
- Employee email field must be filled
- Must be valid email format
- Can't be the same as another employee

### Issue: Employee can't login

**Solution:**
1. Check domain is in hosts file: `127.0.0.1 abc-logistics.carriergo.local`
2. Check database exists: `SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'carriergo_%'`
3. Check user exists in database: `USE carriergo_tenant_2; SELECT * FROM users;`
4. Check password is correct (from success message or email)
